[# Navierâ€“Stokes flow around a cylinder

## Problem Set-up

We consider a fluid with a density of  $\rho=1.0$ and  describe its behavior using the time-dependent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
$$\begin{aligned}
       \mathbf{u}_t + \mathbf{u} \nabla \mathbf{u} + \nabla p - \nu \mathbf{u} = 0, \\
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0,
\end{aligned}$$

with $\mathbf{u}=(u, v)$ defining the velocity field and $p$ the pressure. The kinematic viscosity is taken as $\nu =0.001$.
